
DeconTools (x86) uses the AnyCpu version of this wrapper
https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/DeconTools
- DeconTools does not use pwiz_bindings_cli.dll and thus that file 
  (plus the other ProteoWizard DLLs) should not be in the same folder as DeconConsole.exe


MSFileInfoScanner (AnyCPU) uses the AnyCPU version of this wrapper
https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/MS-File-Info-Scanner
- MSFileInfoScanner also uses pwiz_bindings_cli.dll to read information from instrument data files
  Consequently, all of the 64-bit ProteoWizard DLLs are copied to same folder as MSFileInfoScanner.dll


InformedProteomics.Backend does not use ProteoWizardWrapper
https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Informed-Proteomics/

PbfGen uses InformedProteomics.Backend and thus PbfGen does not require ProteoWizardWrapper

LCMS-Spectator uses PbfGen, but should not require ProteoWizardWrapper
